# plutosdr-fw

I have discovered a better method to modify the PlutoSDR firmware which allows 
you to have multiple firmware development trees without duplicating the big embedded 
submodules here. If you are interested, then please check out the 
[plutosdr-dev](https://github.com/mmaroti/plutosdr-dev) repository.
